    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p>
        Hi my name is Dansel Piamonte I am an amateur web developer
        As well as an experienced graphic designer<br>Since i was young
        I am always fascinated on how websites work , as well designing
        things , where it peaked is when i was in Senior high <br>i was
        heavily inspired with my surroundings and thought i need to step
        up my game , so here i am today making things right for me.<br>
        I am currently in college taking BS-Computerengineering(Bs-Cpe)
